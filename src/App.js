// Review: Jessie's  app is really neat and well coded, Him and I even shared idea because we did our project in different ways, the collaboration helped me a lot. His responsiveness is on point, Color scheme fixing and it's near just like the model we're inspired from. Goodjob overall, fix the position of the the box containers . Good job!
